DEFINITIONS
"This man is [Greek text]."* *Without bowels of affection.[^Reade73]

Why, that will be about thirty pence: the change for a hard* half-crown." *i.e. a half-crown in one piece.[^Reade149]

Mr. Osmond replied that apoplexy was often idiopathic.* Captain Dodd, as he understood, had fallen down in the street in a sudden fit: "but as for the mania, that is to be attributed to an insufficient evacuation of blood while under the apoplectic coma." * "Arising of itself." A term rather hastily applied to disorders the coming signs of which have not been detected by the medical attendant. The birth of Topsy was idopathic, in that learned lady's opinion.[^Reade174] **

"My good friend here informs me, sir, you are so fortunate as to possess a son of distinguished abilities, and who is at present labouring under some of those precursory indications of incipient disease of the cerebro-psychical organs, of which I have been, I may say, somewhat successful in diagnosing the symptoms. Unless I have been misinformed, he has, for a considerable time, experienced persistent headache of a kephalalgic or true cerebral type, and has now advanced to the succeeding stage of taciturnity and depression, not* unaccompanied with isolation, and probably constipation: but as yet without hallucination, though possibly, and, as my experience of the great majority of these cases would induce me to say, probably he is not** undisturbed by one or more of those latent, and, at first, trifling aberrations, either of the intelligence or the senses, which in their preliminary stages escape the observation of all but the expert nosologist." *Anglice, "accompanied." **Anglice, "disturbed."[^Reade175]

It commences at night: the incubator begins by seeing nocturnal visions, often of a photopsic* character, * Luminous.[^Reade177]

"Dec. 8th.—I am an egotist: found myself out this morning; and it is a good thing to keep a diary. It* was overpowered at first by grief for mamma: but now the house is sad and quiet I am always thinking of him; and that is egotism. * Egotism. The abstract quality evolved from the concrete term egotist by feminine art, without the aid of grammar.[^Reade188] 

"My dear," said Billy, with great humility and placidity, "he was killing God's creatures, no allowance: * so, ye see, to save their lives, I was obliged." *Nautical phrase, meaning without stint or limit, or niggardly admeasurement as there is of grog. [^Reade352]


CALCULATIONS AND EVIDENCE FOR DATA
Then Edward was solemnly weighed in his jersey and flannel trousers, and proving only eleven stone eight, whereas he had been ungenerously suspected of twelve stone *There was at this time a prejudice against weight, which has yielded to experience[^Reade16]

The ship no sooner crossed the schooner's bows* than a Malay ran forward with a linstock.*Being disabled, the schooner's head had come round to windward, though she was drifting to leeward.[^Reade99]


Until he felt it there once more, he could hardly realise a stroke of good fortune that seemed miraculous—though, in reality, it was less strange than the way he had lost it;* but now, laid bodily on his heart, it set his bosom on fire. *The Agra, being much larger than the bottle, had drifted faster to leeward in the storm.[^Reade120]
The Commissioners had nothing to do but believe this, and did believe it. Inspectors who visit a temple of darkness, lies, cunning, and hypocrisy, four times a year, know mighty little of what goes on there the odd three hundred and sixty-one days, five hours, forty-eight minutes, and fifty-seven seconds.* * Arithmetic of my boyhood. I hear the world revolves some minutes quicker now. [^Reade288]

The Psycho-cerebrals "took their departure" (Psycho-cerebral for "went away"), and left Jane Hardie brimful of anxiety. Alfred was not there to dispose of the tirade in two words "Petitio principii," and so smoke on; and, not being an university woman, she could not keep her eye on the original assumption while following the series of inferences the learned doctor built so neatly, story by story, on the foundation of the quicksand of a loose conjecture.* * So novices sitting at a conjuror see him take a wedding- ring, and put it in a little box before a lady; then cross the theatre with another little box, and put that before another lady: "Hey! presto! pass!" in box 2 is discovered a wedding-ring, which is instantly assumed to be the ring: on this the green minds are fixed, and with this is sham business done: Box 1, containing the real ring all the time, is overlooked: and the confederate, in livery or not, does what he likes with it; imprisons it in an orange—for the good of its health. So poor Argan, when Fleurant enumerates the consequences of his omitting a single—dose shall I say?—is terrified by the threatened disorders, which succeed to each other logically enough: all the absurdity being in the first link of the chain; and from that his mind is diverted.[^Reade182]

CLARIFICATIONS AND EDITORIAL CORRECTIONS
The madhouse scenes have been picked out by certain disinterested gentlemen, who keep private asylums, and periodicals to puff them; and have been met with bold denials of public facts, and with timid personalities, and a little easy cant about Sensation* Novelists
*This slang term is not quite accurate as applied to me.Without sensation there can be no interest: but my plan is to mix a little character and a little philosophy with the sensational element.[^Reade5]

"Then I babbled something, I forget what: then he went on like this—ah, I never forget what he says—he said Cicero says 'AEquitas ipsa lucet per se; something significat* something else:' *Dubitatio cogitationem significat injuriae.[^Reade190]

"No, but I read the address, and the date inside, and I saw the handwriting; and I was offered the letter, but papa told me it was full of abuse of him, so I declined* to read it; however, I will get it for you." * This was one of those involuntary inaccuracies which creep into mortal statements.[^Reade257]

SARDONIC COMMENTARY: EDITORIALIZING AND CONJECTURE
"Dear me! what if the young gentleman did cry a little, it was very excusable; after such great exertions it was disappointing, mortifying. I pity him for one, and wish he had his mother alive and here, to dry them."* *Oh where, and oh where, was her Lindley Murray gone?[^Reade22]

"In one word, then," said Dr. Wycherley, waxing impatient at their abominable obtuseness, "it is the premonitory stage of the precursory condition of an organic affection of the brain." "Oh!" said Mr. Hardie, "the brain!* I see; the boy is going mad." * What a blessing there are a few English words left in all our dialects.[^Reade175-2]ConjectureShe even tried to solve the mystery of her soi-disant sickness: "I was disturbed by a feeling so new and so powerful,* but, above all, by having a secret from you; the first—the last." *Perhaps even this faint attempt at self-analysis was due to the influence of Dr. Whately. For, by nature, young ladies of this age seldom turn the eye inward.[^Reade64]

And so Infirmity crept about begging leave to cure Disease—with what success may be inferred from this: Miss Phillips, a lady-like girl of eighteen, was taken up by Farmer Giles before Squire Langton for stealing turnips out of a field: the farmer was hard, and his losses in Hardie's Bank had made him bitter hard; so the poor girl's excuse, that she could not let her father starve, had no effect on him: to jail she should go.* *I find, however, that Squire Langton resolutely refused to commit Miss Phillips. The real reason, I suspect, was, that he had a respect for the Gospel, and not much for the law, except those invaluable clauses which restrain poaching. The reason he gave was: "Turnips be hanged! If she hadn't eaten them, the fly would." However, he found means to muzzle Giles, and sent the old doctor two couple of rabbits.[^Reade167]

Once more in Time's whirligig gentlemen and their footmen jostled one another on the Exchange, and a motley crew of peers and printers, vicars and admirals, professors, cooks, costermongers, cotton-spinners, waiters, coachmen, priests, potboys, hankers, braziers, dairymen, mail-guards, barristers, spinsters, butchers, beggars, duchesses, rag-merchants—in one word, of Nobs and Snobs; fought and scrambled pell mell for the popular paper, and all to get rich in a day.* *For the humours of the time see the parliamentary return of Railway Subscribers, published 1846: Francis's British Railway: Evan's Commercial Crisis; and the pamphlets and journals of the day.[^Reade92]

But he felt so ill-used, he paid for it in his own notes: by this means the treaty reverted to the primitive form of barter*—ashes for rags. * Or exchange of commodities without the aid of money: see Homer, and Welsh Villages, passim.[^Reade163]

The old man cheated the emetic; for, before it could hurt him, he died of the bath; And his body told its own sad tale; to use the words of a medical eye-witness, it was "A PIECE OF ALABASTER." The death-torrent had driven the whole circulation from the surface.* * This mode of execution is well known in the United States. They settle refractory prisoners with it periodically. But half an hour is not needed; twenty minutes will do the trick. "Harper's Weekly," a year or two ago, contained an admirable woodcut of a negro's execution by water. In this remarkable picture you see the poor darkie seated powerless, howling and panting his life away under the deadly cascade, and there stands the stolid turnkey, erect, formal, stiff as a ramrod, pulling the deadly string with a sort of drill exercise air, and no more compunction nor reflection than if he himself was a machine constructed to pull strings or triggers on his own string being pulled by butcher or fool. A picture well studied, and so worth study. [^Reade292-293]
