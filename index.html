<p>
I am currently a Postdoctoral Associate and Perkins Fellow at the Center for Digital Humanities at Princeton University. I received my PhD in English and Comparative Literature from Columbia University in August 2020. I study and teach the intersection of literary form, systems of information, and labor, from the nineteenth century to the present. My research, broadly speaking, takes a historical approach to critical data studies, cultural analytics, and the history of the novel in English.

Currently, I am working on a book project about the process of information storage, organization, and retrieval that shaped the narrative techniques of British novel in the age of statistics and state archives. Iâ€™m also at work on second project: an experiment in quantitative methods and disciplinary history.
