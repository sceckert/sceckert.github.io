<p>
I'm Sierra Eckert, a PhD candidate in Columbia University's Department
of English and Comparative Literature. I study and teach
nineteenth-century literature and the history and theory of data. My
research, broadly speaking, includes Victorian literature and print
culture, the history of literary criticism, and literary informatics.

<p>
Currently, I'm working on a project that examines the nineteenth-century
archival imagination and the relationship between literary form, reading
practice, and Victorian methods and theories of collecting, preserving,
and organizing knowledge.
