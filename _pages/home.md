I'm Sierra Eckert, a PhD candidate in Columbia University's Department
of English and Comparative Literature. I study and teach
nineteenth-century literature and the history and theory of data. My
research, broadly speaking, includes Victorian literature and print
culture, the history of literary criticism, and literary informatics.

Currently, I'm working on a project that examines the nineteenth-century
archival imagination and the relationship between literary form, reading
practice, and Victorian methods and theories of collecting, preserving,
and organizing knowledge.

This site houses my ongoing research work and other professional
material. My (CV)[{{ site.url }}/cv/] and [current projects]({{ site.url }}/support/projects/) can be found under their respective tabs.
